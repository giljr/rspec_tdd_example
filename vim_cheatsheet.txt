Vim Cheat Sheet for Rails Development in tmux
============================================

1️⃣ Modes
---------
Normal mode: Esc        → Navigate, issue commands
Insert mode: i          → Type/edit text
Command mode: :         → Enter commands like save/quit

Mnemonic: "Escapes to Normal, then : for Commands"

2️⃣ Saving & Exiting
-------------------
Write & Quit: :wq       → Write your changes, then quit
Quit without saving: :q! → Force quit without writing
Just quit: :q           → Quit only if nothing changed

Mnemonic for :wq → "Write first, then Quit"

Steps:
1. Esc → Normal mode

4. Enter → Done
